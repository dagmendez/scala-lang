As mentioned in our [Roadmap for 2024](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2024/02/06/scala-center-2024-roadmap.html), in an effort to promote the positive image of Scala and to recognize the independent work of active community members who dedicate their time to giving back to the community, we are launching a new initiative called the Scala Ambassadors.

With the Scala Ambassadors initiative, the Scala Center aims to provide and foster a space for the Ambassadors to help each other and discuss topics that arise in their community work. We will also offer our support by providing them with a platform in promoting their activities on the Scala Center's social media. This way, the Ambassadors will gain more visibility and their work will gain more reach.

As an ordinary Scala user, the initiative is aimed to put the active and helpful individuals in the community on your radar. Whether you have a question about how to start speaking at a conference or organize a local meetup, or you're not sure about your next steps in Scala, they are the people to reach out to.

Currently, we are in the process of selecting and onboarding the first group of Ambassadors. Stay tuned for more information about the Scala Ambassadors initiative and the Ambassadors themselves!
